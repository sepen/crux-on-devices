### About this device

This device was purchased on ebay in 2006 for around â‚¬60 and came with a charger, dock station and a compatible pcmcia wifi card.

Released in 2000 and originally designed to run WinCE 3.0, but there were already people who had managed to get linux on it.
And several very interesting linux distributions optimized for this device appeared, such as [JLime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jlime)
and [Familiar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Familiar_Linux).
This is what motivated my friend Victor Martinez and I to start porting CRUX to this device, and eventually found CRUX-ARM.

In this document I will document my installation and personal configuration. If you are looking for CRUX-ARM documentation about this
process you can find it [here](https://crux-arm.nu/SupportedDevices/J72x).
